# Next Session Handoff

Everything you need to pick up where iterations 9 + 10 left off, written for whoever opens the next chat.

---

## Where things stand right now

- **Branch**: `iteration-9-and-10` (merge of iter-9 + iter-10, not merged to main)
- **Tests**: 225 passing, typecheck clean
- **Auto mode**: ON
- **Notification system**: in place (iter 6) — `useNotifications().notify({...})` available everywhere
- **Iteration plans + close-outs**: see `ITERATION{8,9,10}_PLAN.md` / `_COMPLETE.md`
- **NFA mode is live** (iter 8): ε-transitions (configurable reserved char), multi-state simulation with ε-closure, edge consolidation in both DFA and NFA modes, branch-death pulse
- **Undo/Redo is live** (iter 9): snapshot stack capped at 50, two floating circular buttons at top-center, `⌘/Ctrl+Z` and `⌘/Ctrl+Shift+Z` shortcuts (suppressed in text fields), Clear canvas wipes both stacks
- **Aliveness pass shipped** (iter 10): eased tab-card swap in the tool menu, idle breathing on the start arrow and accept rings, single motion vocabulary (220ms hover / 80ms press / 280ms toast spring) across buttons, tool-menu items, alphabet badges, editor row actions, and notification toasts. Engine / tests untouched.

## Wes's working style (read before starting)

This is the most important section. The user is a CS student building skills as a developer. Conventions that have emerged:

### Mode preferences
- **Mentor mode** (`/mentor`) — used when actively learning. User writes the code; you explain concepts and walk through decisions without writing code yourself. Reference `~/.claude/rules/mentor-mode.md` for full rules.
- **Execution mode** — used when shipping features. Auto-mode active. You write code, commit per phase, run tests, screenshot to verify.
- The default is execution. **Switch to mentor only if explicitly invoked.** Iter 5 had a "let's do mentor mode" stretch that the user ultimately abandoned because they were stressed; they want to do reviews AFTER the code ships, not during.

### Iteration discipline
- Every iteration starts with `ITERATION{N}_PLAN.md` *before* writing any code.
- Iteration ends with `ITERATION{N}_COMPLETE.md` summarizing what shipped.
- Phases within an iteration get their own commits (Phase 1 / Phase 2 / etc).
- Tests + typecheck + visual verify before each commit.
- One thing at a time. The user gets actively frustrated when changes cascade unexpectedly. Don't refactor scope you weren't asked to refactor.

### What the user values
- **The #1 rule**: the tool menu (Configure / Edit / Simulate cards) must always fit the viewport. The active card scrolls internally; compact cards stay visible. Don't break this.
- **Discoverable UX over clever shortcuts.** Buttons disabled with explanatory instruction text > buttons that change label.
- **Direct manipulation of visuals.** Canvas-first editing, not table-based.
- **Honest feedback.** When the user pushes back on something, take it seriously. They're often right; when they're not, explain *why* with concrete reasoning rather than appeasing.
- **Architectural patterns documented as we go.** `ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERNS.md` grows with each iteration.

### What the user dislikes
- Yellow as a UI color (just shipped — Modify is now violet)
- Layouts that grow infinitely without bounds
- Modal popups that overlap content they're meant to interact with
- Excessive cleverness when a simple approach would do
- Sycophancy / flattery in your responses

## Iteration 9: Undo / Redo — shipped

All edits are reversible via snapshot-stack undo/redo. Details in
`ITERATION9_COMPLETE.md`. The snapshot tuple is `{ automaton,
epsilonSymbol }` — folded together so one undo action = one user-visible
state restoration. Stacks capped at 50; Clear canvas wipes both.

One follow-up worth noting: when JSON import eventually lands, its
handler should call `clearHistory()` after replacing the automaton, same
as `handleClearCanvas` does today.

## Other items captured but not yet implemented

These are documented in iteration plans / audits but are still open:

### From iter 5 audit (deferred, still open)
- State renaming (custom labels)
- Auto-increment transition form (the table-era idea — N/A now)
- Empty-string simulation
- "Warn before delete if there are dependents" preference toggle

### From iter 6 audit (deferred, still open)
- Notification system polish (already shipped, no major issues known)
- ~~Self-loop visualization in the mini SVG~~ (dropped — explicit decision: rendering source = destination as the same pair-graphic is desirable; clearly two distinct slots)

### From iter 7
- State rename in the actions popover
- Maybe: hover preview of the to-be-deleted edge before clicking Delete

### Unreachable-state warning surfacing
The validator already detects unreachable states (`getOrphanedStates`,
surfaced as a warning in `getValidationReport`). But warnings only render
in the Simulate tab when the automaton isn't runnable — a runnable
automaton with orphans never shows the warning. Future iteration: surface
warnings persistently (top of canvas? toast on edit?) so the user knows
about unreachable states even when sim is fine. Could also be a soft visual
on the canvas (faded state? dashed outline?). Worth checking how the
warning is most useful before settling on placement.

### From iter 8 audit (deferred / nice-to-have)
- Per-branch NFA simulation UI: tabs or trees showing each branch independently. Right now all active states render in the same layer of blue.
- More NFA/ε visual tweaks: maybe a subtler dashed style on ε-edge labels (user explicitly said *no* dashed line for ε in iter 8 — keep solid — but the label could still flag it).
- Reserved-`e` rule on JSON load (auto-handle when import lands).

### From iter 10 (deferred follow-ups)
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — suspend the breathing keyframes (start arrow, accept rings) and drop hover transition durations. Non-blocking; accessibility polish.
- Page-load entry animation for the canvas.
- State mount / unmount animation when a state is added or removed (structural change visualization).

### From CLAUDE.md backlog
- Iteration 9: Undo/Redo — shipped (see `ITERATION9_COMPLETE.md`)
- Iteration 10: NFA → DFA conversion (subset construction), minimization, equivalence testing
- Iteration 11: Edge routing & overlap prevention

### "Code" / terminal panel for programmatic automaton authoring
Captured during iter 7 follow-up. Add a fourth tool-menu tab (alongside
Configure / Edit / Simulate) that exposes a small DSL terminal:

- **Audience**: technical users who'd rather type than click, plus
  automated agents driving the app via terminal input.
- **DSL shape**: each command maps 1:1 to an existing engine primitive
  so the surface area stays small. Sketch:
  ```
  add state q3
  start q0
  accept q2
  add transition q0 0 q1
  remove transition q0 0
  set type NFA
  add symbol a
  ```
- **Bidirectional**: typing a command updates the model AND vice versa
  — the panel could echo a command stream as the user clicks around in
  Edit, which doubles as a tutorial / replay log.
- **Out of scope for now**: macros, conditionals, file I/O. Just a thin
  imperative layer over the engine. Aim for "one command per intent."

### Pseudo-`?` state for incomplete DFAs (educational visualization)
Captured during iter 7 follow-up. When a DFA is incomplete (some
state/symbol pairs have no transition), the Simulate tab refuses to
run. That's a teaching opportunity instead of a wall:

- **Idea**: in the Simulate view (and *only* there), render a phantom
  state labeled `?` and route all undefined transitions to it. Pure
  visualization — no simulation interactivity, the `?` state isn't
  reachable for actual runs (the DFA is still flagged as incomplete).
- **Visual**: dashed stroke on both the `?` circle and the dashed
  edges going to it. Different enough from a real trap/dead state that
  the user reads it as "this is a hint, not a real state."
- **Pedagogy gate**: a one-time explanation tooltip — "Undefined
  transitions are shown going to a ? state so you can see what's
  missing. Add the missing transitions to make the DFA complete."
- **Out of scope**: the `?` state is *not* part of the engine's
  Automaton type. It's purely UI. Don't pollute the data model.

## Bugs / issues to watch for

- **GraphViz layout edge cases**: tightly connected DFAs render fine but can have arrow/label overlap. Documented in CLAUDE.md memory file.
- **The start-state arrow viewBox fix is hardcoded to 70px**. If the arrow length changes, this should too.
- **State-actions popover doesn't close when canvas re-layouts**: the anchor rect is captured at click time. If layout changes (e.g. add state triggers re-layout), the popover stays where it was. Probably fine in practice.

## How to verify in the browser

A vite-dev server is already configured in `.claude/launch.json`:

```bash
# usually just:
npm run dev
# or use the Claude Preview MCP server
```

Quick checks to run before saying "this works":
1. `npm test -- --run` — all 169 tests passing
2. `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean
3. Screenshot via the preview server — verify the visual matches intent
4. For interactive features: build a small DFA in Edit tab, simulate a string, check the canvas highlights work

## A note on the conversation history

The chat history that produced iter 6 + iter 7 is long and circuitous. If you read back through it, the key emotional beats:

- Iter 6's transition table was a multi-day struggle that produced little value. We rewrote it 3 times in different forms (table → custom dropdown → CSS Grid → start over). The user got understandably frustrated. The lesson: when a UI approach keeps requiring fixes that introduce new fixes, the constraint mismatch is the problem, not the implementation. Pivot the approach, don't keep patching.

- The visual transition editor (iter 7) was the user's idea, sketched in plain prose. It worked beautifully on the first plan draft. The lesson: trust the user's UX intuitions for their own product.

- The user wants to do post-iteration code reviews where you walk them through each file. Currently deferred. They flagged it explicitly: they want to do this *after* the build is done, when the stress of shipping is off. Be ready to do this in future sessions if asked.

- Mentor mode hooks: the user activates this with `/mentor`. It's documented in `~/.claude/rules/mentor-mode.md` (their global rules). When in mentor mode, you do not write code — you guide and explain.
